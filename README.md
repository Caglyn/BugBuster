# BugBuster
Within the scope of the Game and App Jam organized by the Google Game and App Academy with the theme of "Unexpected Hero", we came 3rd with our game BugBuster. <br> <br>
In BugBuster, you're a Capsule who is trying to fix the bugs and incomplete parkours in a game where the game's developer fell asleep and left the game unfinished. <br>
The game's a Platformer/Puzzle game and contains features like Inventory and Build systems similar to the games in Survival genre. <br><br>
You can go see the "Playable Build" directory to play the game. <br> <br>
Here's the trailer of the game:
